### 1_Replicate_RF_NoAdaptation.py
This file uses Carleton et al.'s data to replicate the mortality temperature response functions without adaptation. The response functions will be saved in three different .csv files: oldest.csv, older.csv, and young.csv. Each row corresponds to an impact region and the columns corresponds to a decigrade. The entries of the files refer to the number of deaths in a specific temperature and impact region. 


### 2_Create_RF_Adaptation.py
This file requires the $historical$ and $future$ NSAT files of the climate ensemble. The $historical$ data encompass the period between 1984-2014 and the $future$ data encompass the period between 2015-2100. For simplicity, these files were renamed
- tas_Amon_{climate_model}\_historical_{label}_{grid}_1984-2014.nc
- tas_Amon_{climate_model}_{scenario}_{label}_{grid}_2015-2100.nc
