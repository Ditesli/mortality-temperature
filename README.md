# MSc Thesis
In this repository you can find the main code and useful instructions to replicate the results of my Master's Thesis in Climate Physics: Mortality impacts of temperature extremes: Insights from Climate Model Projections and Integration into the MIMOSA Model.

The folder is structured as follows:
1. $\text{{\bf Climate data}}$: Includes the necessarty scripts to generate the necessary climate data to be used throughout the whole project.
2. Response_functions
3. GDP_POP
4. Mortality_projections
5. MIMOSA
6. Figures

In addition, this repository works with three main folders:
1. Carleton et al's data
2. Climate models data
In this case, some scripts still have the climate models information I used. More information on how to retreive this data in folder 1.
